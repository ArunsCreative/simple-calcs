<h2>  What is EMI? </h2> 

EMI stands for Equated Monthly Installment. It is the fixed amount a borrower pays every month to a lender to repay a loan. EMI includes both principal and interest components and remains constant throughout the loan tenure.

<h2> How does EMI work? </h2>

EMI depends on three factors: loan amount, interest rate, and loan tenure. A higher tenure reduces EMI but increases total interest, while a lower tenure increases EMI but reduces interest paid.
